# Task System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete task creation and assignment system with the following components:

### 1. Database Schema
- **tasks table**: Stores task data with ai_confidence field and assignment metadata
- **task_assignments table**: Audit log of all task assignments
- **Proper indices**: For efficient querying by status, assignment, and confidence

### 2. Task Service (`apps/api/src/services/task.service.ts`)

Implemented core business logic:

#### Task Creation
- `createTasksFromImportJob()`: Creates tasks from valid import rows with healthy links
- Only processes rows with `status='valid'` and `link_status='ok'`
- Extracts AI confidence from raw_ai_output JSON
- Prevents duplicate task creation

#### Assignment Strategies

**Equal Split Assignment:**
- `assignTasksEqualSplit()`: Distributes tasks evenly among specified users
- Supports quota limits per user
- Round-robin distribution algorithm
- Batch updates in single transaction

**Pull Queue Assignment:**
- `getNextTask()`: Users pull highest-priority unassigned tasks
- Priority based on ai_confidence (highest first)
- Row-level locking prevents race conditions
- Automatic assignment on retrieval

#### Monitoring
- `getTaskStats()`: Overall statistics (total, pending, completed, etc.)
- `getUserTasks()`: All tasks assigned to specific user
- `getAssignmentLogs()`: Audit trail with filtering options

### 3. API Routes (`apps/api/src/routes/task.routes.ts`)

Exposed RESTful endpoints:

- **POST /tasks/create**: Create tasks from import job
- **POST /tasks/assign**: Equal-split batch assignment
- **GET /tasks/next**: Pull next highest-priority task
- **GET /tasks/stats**: Task statistics
- **GET /tasks/user/:userId**: User's assigned tasks
- **GET /tasks/assignments**: Assignment audit logs

### 4. Documentation (`apps/api/docs/TASK_API.md`)

Comprehensive API documentation with:
- Detailed endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Data model definitions
- Assignment strategy explanations
- Complete workflow examples

### 5. Testing (`apps/api/scripts/test-tasks.sh`)

Shell script for testing all task endpoints:
- Creates import job
- Creates tasks from import
- Tests both assignment strategies
- Verifies statistics and logs

## Key Features

### Task Creation Rules
1. Only creates tasks for rows with valid data and healthy links
2. Prevents duplicate task creation for same import row
3. Extracts and stores AI confidence for priority sorting

### Assignment Features

**Equal Split:**
- Batch assignment for known user groups
- Configurable quota per user
- Even distribution algorithm
- Single transaction for consistency

**Pull Queue:**
- On-demand task retrieval
- Priority-based (AI confidence)
- Pessimistic locking for concurrency
- Automatic assignment on pull

### Audit & Monitoring
- Complete assignment history in task_assignments table
- Task statistics by status
- User-specific task queries
- Filterable assignment logs

## Integration Points

### With Import System
- Tasks created from import_rows table
- Only processes rows with valid CSV data
- Respects link health status from assets table

### With Link Health Checker
- Only creates tasks for URLs with link_status='ok'
- Filters out broken, timed out, or invalid links
- Ensures tasks have accessible resources

## Database Relationships

```sql
import_jobs (1) --> (*) import_rows
import_rows (1) --> (0..1) tasks
import_rows (1) --> (0..1) assets (link health)
tasks (*) --> (*) task_assignments (audit log)
```

## Usage Workflow

1. **Import CSV**: Upload CSV file via import API
2. **Link Health Check**: Worker validates all URLs
3. **Create Tasks**: Generate tasks from healthy rows
4. **Assign Tasks**: Choose equal-split or pull-queue
5. **Process Tasks**: Users work on assigned tasks
6. **Monitor Progress**: Track stats and assignments

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
cd apps/api/scripts
./test-tasks.sh
```

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
1. Task completion endpoints
2. Bulk status updates
3. Task reassignment
4. Priority overrides
5. Team-based assignment
6. Performance metrics
7. WebSocket notifications
8. Task deadlines/SLAs

## Technical Stack

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with transactions
- **API**: Fastify with TypeScript
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Concurrency**: Row-level locking
- **Architecture**: Service layer pattern

## Success Metrics

✅ Tasks created only from valid, healthy data
✅ Two flexible assignment strategies
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
✅ RESTful API with documentation
✅ Test scripts for verification
✅ Type-safe implementation
✅ Scalable architecture
